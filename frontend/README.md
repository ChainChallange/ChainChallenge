## How to Run the Application

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Node.js and Yarn installed on your machine. If Yarn is not installed, you can install it globally using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install -g yarn
   ```

2. **Install Project Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn 
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**: Start the development server to run the application locally. This command will compile the project and serve it on a local server (usually `http://localhost:3000`):
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

4. **Build for Production**: Compile the application for production. This step optimizes the build for better performance:
   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

5. **Start the Production Server**: After building the application, you can start the production server to serve the optimized build:
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

By following these steps, you can set up, develop, and deploy the frontend application efficiently.
